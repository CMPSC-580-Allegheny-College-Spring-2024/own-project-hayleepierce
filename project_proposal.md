## Introduction

```
TODO: Introduce the proposed project, providing a concise summary of the project goals, its key elements, offering the reader a quick understanding of the research's scope. The section continues to outline the main topics, research questions, hypotheses, and /or theories in a clear and meaningful language to provide a type of roadmap for the reader to navigate the forthcoming details of the project. This section also needs to motivate the project by providing context for the study, outlining the current state of knowledge in the field, and highlighting any gaps or limitations in existing research. The section serves as a foundational guide that enables the reader to grasp the context of the study, in addition to its structure, before moving into a more technically-based discussion in the following sections of the article. In short, the "Introduction" section needs to answer the `what` and `why` questions, that is `what is the project?` and `why is the project important?`
```

## Literature Review

```
TODO (10 source minimum, with 5 of those being published peer-reviewed articles): Conduct literature review by describing relevant work related to the project and hence providing an overview of the state of the art in the area of the project. This section serves to contextualize the study within the existing body of literature, presenting a thorough review of relevant prior research and scholarly contributions. In clear and meaningful language, this section aims to demonstrate the problems, gaps, controversies, or unanswered questions that are associated with the current understanding of the topic. In addition, this section serves to highlight the current study's unique contribution to the field. By summarizing and critiquing existing works, this section provides a foundation for readers to appreciate the novelty and significance of the study in relation to the broader academic discourse. The "Literature Review" section further (in detail) contributes to the `why is the project important?` question.

### Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the emotion/tone behind a piece of text. There are numerous models that are pre-trained to perform sentiment analysis, including VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), TextBlob, and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The majority of existing literature uses VADER and/or TextBlob to analyze text from social media posts [1, 2, 3]. The VADER model provides a positive, negative, and neutral score that add to a total of 100. A downside to this model is that it was trained using data from social media; consequently, analysis of any other type of text is not guaranteed to be accurate. The TextBlob model produces a polarity score between -1 and 1 and a subjectivity score between 0 and 1. Unfortunately, the documentation about what data was used to train the model is lacking. Some of the literature uses BERT

### Data: Gathering and Preparing

[6, 7, 8, 9]

### User Interface

[10]

## Prototype

```
TODO: Discuss the methods of the project to be able to answer the `how` question (`how was this project completed?`). For this section, you must describe  the methodology behind your implemented prototype. The methods section in an academic research outlines the specific procedures, techniques, and methodologies employed to conduct the study, offering a transparent and replicable framework for the research. It details the resources behind the work, in terms of, for example, the design of the algorithm and the experiment(s), data collection methods, applied software libraries, required tools, the types of statistical analyses and models which are applied to ensure the rigor and validity of the study. This section provides clarity for other researchers to understand and potentially replicate the study, contributing to the overall reliability and credibility of the research findings.
```

## Preliminary Results and Outcomes

```
TODO: Discuss the outcomes of your project in this section. Depending on the project type, the presented results and outcomes will vary. In some projects, you will be asked to present a theoretical analysis, and in others your experimental study and its results. In this section, you are also to demonstrate an enhanced version of your artifact by showing its capabilities and applications, in light of the evaluation metrics for assessing the artifact
```

## Conclusions and Future Work

```
TODO: Summarize your work and outline future steps needed to complete to take the project to the next stage (for example, if you were to continue with this project in 600/610). You must also address ethical implications of your project, especially as pertains to the public release or use of your software or methods.
